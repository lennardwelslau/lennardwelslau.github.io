              We investigate export competition between China and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) in the United States market between 2002 and 2022. Using a sample of 33 exporters and 10-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HS) level trade data, we estimate a structural gravity model using an instrumental variable constructed from Chinese exports to eight other industrialized nations. We use a first-order Taylor-series expansion à la Baier and Bergstrand (2009a) to approximate the multilateral price terms pointed out by Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003). The results show that the impact of Chinese exports on United States imports from LAC is negative and statistically significant across several model specifications, levels of aggregation, and sectors. A percentage increase in imports from China decreased imports from LAC by ca. 0.75 percent. The displacement effect is ca. 0.32 for manufacturing products, 1.01 for resourcebased products, 1.33 when estimated only for South America, 0.25 for the Caribbean, and not significant for Central America.

              Structural reforms that increase labour market flexibility have conventionally been believed to facilitate employment stability. These stability benefits depend on the responsiveness of employment to labour cost adjustments. In a standard New Keynesian model, this responsiveness depends on the endogenous reaction of monetary policy. Galí and Monacelli (2016) find that in a monetary union, changes in labour costs therefore have only minimal effects on employment and that increasing wage flexibility may be welfare reducing in some cases. Recent advances in the HANK literature, however, have shown that the presence of borrowing constrained heterogeneous households can alter relevant transmission dynamics. Using a small open economy HANK model, I first simulate a temporary payroll tax cut and compare responses for a Taylor rule and a monetary union and show that employment is responsive to labour cost reductions under both monetary regimes, with the response primarily driven by the effect of higher income on consumption and the multiplier effect. These effects are independent of the endogenous response of monetary policy, breaking with traditional New Keynesian logic. I then simulate both a foreign interest rate and a foreign demand shock at varying levels of wage flexibility and assess respective welfare losses and find that: (i) Wage flexibility increases the responsiveness of employment in the face of adverse foreign shocks; (ii) In a monetary union, wage flexibility results in substantial relative welfare losses, especially for poorer households, driven by income and multiplier effects, while for a Taylor rule, welfare effects are smaller and co-determined by the monetary policy response; (iii) Under both monetary regimes, a one for one increase of price and wage flexibility has only minimal welfare effects, while a decrease of flexibility results in relative gains for an interest rate shock and relative losses for a foreign demand shock.          </div>

              In the new European Union fiscal framework proposed by the European Commission in April 2023, medium-term fiscal adjustment requirements would be determined by country-by-country debt sustainability analysis (DSA), the 3 percent deficit ceiling and simple rules requiring minimum deficit and debt adjustments (‘safeguards’). These elements are controversial, with some EU countries (and ourselves) preferring a DSA-based approach, while others prefer to stick to simple rules. This paper evaluates the proposal by replicating the DSA methodology and computing fiscal adjustment implications for all EU countries with debt above 60 percent or deficits above 3 percent of GDP. We find that the proposed framework would require ambitious fiscal adjustment: on average, more than 2 percent of GDP over the medium term, in addition to the adjustment that is already planned for 2023-24. However, for most high-debt countries, these requirements are below those implied by the current framework. We also find that for most countries with debt above 60 percent of GDP, these adjustment requirements are driven by the DSA rather than the safeguards, but with significant exceptions. The main exception is France, for which the ‘debt safeguard’ – which requires debt to fall within four years – imposes much higher fiscal adjustment than the DSA. If the adjustment period were to be extended from four to seven years (as is possible under the framework for countries that submit growth-enhancing reform and investment plans), the safeguards would also be binding for several other countries. In addition, a requirement to reduce the deficit by at least half a percent per year if it exceeds 3 percent of GDP could become binding ex post, in response to output shocks, even if countries implement the fiscal adjustment required ex ante. Finally, we find that while the Commission’s DSA methodology is reasonable, it would benefit from review. This should be done by an independent expert group in consultation with the Commission, member states and other stakeholders, and endorsed by the Council. We recommend the endorsement of the Commission’s proposal after ambiguous aspects are clarified, the debt safeguard and other safeguards are removed or modified, the excessive deficit procedure is reformed to avoid procyclical adjustment, and a process for reviewing the DSA methodology is put in place.

            <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
              Debt issuance by the European Commission on behalf of the European Union has increased massively. Of the approximately €400 billion in outstanding EU debt as of May 2023, 85 percent has arisen from borrowing since 2020. Large-scale borrowing is expected to continue until 2026 to fund the remainder of NextGenerationEU, and concessional loans to support Ukraine. When these programmes were launched, interest rates were at historic lows – even negative for maturities below 10 years. However, interest rates rose sharply in 2022. Beyond the widespread rise in euro-denominated interest rates due to monetary tightening by the European Central Bank in response to the inflation surge, the EU has also faced a widening of the spread between its yields and those of major European issuers, including France and Germany. This widening is driven by a combination of market features, circumstantial factors and institutional features. The European Commission should continue to try to narrow the spread with major European sovereigns by further developing the relevant market infrastructure and improving its issuance strategy. The Commission will not be able to do this alone. Institutional developments, including progress on the development of new own resources and a long-term substantial presence in the bond market, will be necessary to fully reap the benefits of EU borrowing. A large share of EU borrowing (around €421 billion in total by the end of 2026, in current prices) is intended to finance unprecedented non-repayable support: Recovery and Resilience Fund grants and additional funding for existing EU programmes under the EU budget. The interest costs associated with this part of the debt lie with the EU budget. Our estimates suggest that, because of the high current and expected levels of interest rates, this cost could be twice as high as what was initially estimated at the start of the EU’s 2021-27 budget cycle. As a result, because interest costs for the borrowing of the non-repayable support are accounted for under the EU budget’s ‘expenditure ceiling’, this will exert further pressure on the funding of important EU programmes, which are already affected by inflation. The EU should thus quickly review how interest costs are accounted for in its budget and financial framework.            </div>

              This study documents the poor track record of implementation of the European Semester country-specific recommendations and discusses the novelties the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) could bring to EU economic governance. While it is too early to evaluate the success of the RRF, this study draws out lessons for the future of the EU economic governance framework from certain aspects of the RRF design and the European Commission’s evaluation of the national recovery and resilience plans. This document was provided by the Economic Governance and EMU Scrutiny Unit at the request of the ECON Committee.

              The pandemic and subsequent price shocks triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have increased longer-term fiscal pressures in the European Union through higher debt, higher expected real interest rates and higher public investment needs. This Policy Brief makes some simple quantitative assessments of those effects and discusses policy implications, with the following results. First, long-term increases in primary fiscal balances required to offset higher debt and higher expected real interest rates are in the range of 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent of GDP for most EU countries. However, because of pre-existing differences in fiscal space, not all countries will need to undertake that adjustment, while some countries may need to adjust by substantially more. Among the 21 EU countries for which we have data to undertake this analysis, 14 will need to adjust by more than they were planning to do by 2025. Second, the required additional fiscal adjustment looks manageable, although it is substantial in some cases. To achieve medium-term debt-reducing primary balances, several EU countries will need to raise primary balances by more than 2 percent of GDP above their 2025 target, but no country will need additional fiscal adjustment of more than 3 percent of GDP. Third, market data suggests that the future path of real interest rates is very uncertain. Compared to the period immediately preceding the pandemic, longer-term expected real interest rates have increased by about 2 percentage points but remain low on average, at about 1 percent in real terms. Future developments depend on whether the structural factors that led to low interest rates in the first place persist or unwind. While interest rates might decline again, fiscal policymakers should not make plans that assume such a decline. Fourth, public spending needs for additional defence and climate spending run well above 1 percent of GDP per year. These needs do not appear to have been incorporated into current fiscal baselines, and hence will come on top of the adjustment described above. To ensure that fiscal adjustment does not defeat its purpose by slowing growth, it is essential that it is conducted gradually. In countries that require such adjustment, it should start as soon as cyclical conditions allow.

              The costs related to the payment of the interest and principal on the European Union debt issued to finance the non-repayable part of post-pandemic recovery programme must be covered by the EU budget. It is therefore crucial for the EU to understand how these costs could evolve up to 2058, when the debt is expected to be fully reimbursed. Our median estimates show that yearly interest costs borne by the EU budget could increase quickly in the next few years to reach 10.8 EUR billion (i.e. 0.05% of EU GDP) in 2030, before decreasing gradually up to 2058. Overall, total costs over the whole life of the NGEU borrowing scheme could amount to around 222 EUR billion – i.e. 0.6% of one year of average EU GDP over the whole programme – a number that could be reduced by 25 EUR billion if the EU spread vs the Bund was normalising to its early 2022 level. Taking also into account the repayment of the debt, total annual financial needs could reach 25 EUR billion in 2030, before declining gradually towards 14 EUR billion per year by the end of the programme. The ‘Own Resources’ package proposed by the European Commission in June 2023 could thus be enough to cover these costs, under two strong conditions: its estimates are accurate and it is accepted by EU countries in its current form. However, our analysis also emphasises the very large uncertainty surrounding interest rates during the next three-and-a-half decades of the programme.
